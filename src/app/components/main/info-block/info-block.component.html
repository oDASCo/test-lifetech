    Water pollution is very serious,  too.
    Ugly  rivers  of  dirty water polluted with factory waste, poisoned fish are
    all-round  us.  And  polluted air and poisoned water lead to the end of the civilization.
    So,  nowadays  a lot of dead
    lands and lifeless areas have appeared. Because our actions  and dealings can turn the land to a desert.
